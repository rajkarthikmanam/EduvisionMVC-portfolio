  <h3>Raj Karthik Manam</h3>
  <p><strong>Role:</strong> Backend Developer • System Architect </p>
  <ul>
     Karthik developed the backend architecture, API integrations, and database logic
     connecting students, instructors, and departments. He implemented secure authentication,
     EF Core models, and Botpress integration for intelligent assistant support.
     Additionally, he handled Git version control, merge conflicts, deployment configuration and quality assurance testing,
     ensuring a robust, scalable foundation for EduVision.

<h2 class="mt-5">🧑‍💻 Self Reflections</h2>

<div class="card p-4 m-2 shadow-sm bg-light">
  <h4>Raj Karthik Manam — Self Reflection</h4>
  
  <p><strong>⏱️ Time Spent:</strong><br/>
  Worked consistently over three weeks, averaging 15–18 hours per week. Most of the time was spent debugging database migrations, configuring Azure CI/CD, and testing deployment dependencies across the three role-based dashboards.</p>

  <p><strong>📚 Key Learnings:</strong><br/>
  Gained deep practical understanding of the Azure deployment pipeline (GitHub Actions with publish profiles), environment management between Development and Production, and database migration handling in Entity Framework Core. Strengthened version-control discipline with Git and learned how small configuration changes in Program.cs or appsettings can cascade across dependent dashboards.</p>

  <p><strong>⚠️ Challenges and Solutions:</strong><br/>
  The biggest challenge was deployment: each change in one dashboard affected shared models and caused authentication or seeding errors in others. By isolating migrations, enforcing clear role-based routing, and adding diagnostic endpoints, I stabilized the environment. Continuous collaboration with Ananya during each deploy iteration helped identify layout regressions quickly.</p>

  <p><strong>💡 Suggestions for Improvement:</strong><br/>
  In future projects, I plan to improve my time estimation and automate testing pipelines early to reduce manual debugging. Better documentation of migration versions and shared model ownership will make cross-dashboard updates smoother. I also want to strengthen communication loops so that UI and backend validation happen in parallel rather than sequentially.</p>

  <h4>Ananya Gullapally — Self Reflection</h4>
  
  <p><strong>⏱️ Time Spent:</strong><br/>
  Dedicated roughly 12–15 hours per week over three weeks, focusing primarily on the frontend, interface refinements, and integrating Chart.js visualizations. Additional time was spent syncing the UI with backend controllers and testing role-based flows for Students, Instructors, and Admins.</p>

  <p><strong>📚 Key Learnings:</strong><br/>
  Enhanced understanding of how MVC controllers and Razor views exchange data through view models, and how design consistency affects usability. Improved knowledge of Git collaboration (branch management, merges, and conflict resolution) and gained confidence in debugging CSS and Bootstrap layouts that interact with dynamic data.</p>

  <p><strong>⚠️ Challenges and Solutions:</strong><br/>
  The primary challenge was maintaining a unified visual design while backend APIs and database schemas evolved. Frequent schema changes initially broke the visual bindings. Through coordinated testing with Karthik and incremental pushes, I learned to stabilize front-end assets and manage layout dependencies gracefully.</p>

  <p><strong>💡 Suggestions for Improvement:</strong><br/>
  I plan to increase my backend involvement to anticipate schema changes earlier. Next time, I'll improve early coordination between frontend and backend commits to prevent integration conflicts. Strengthening my familiarity with Azure and EF Core will help me assist in deployment troubleshooting. I'll also prioritize more rigorous UI/UX testing sessions with real users before final deployments.</p>
